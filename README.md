Slim libraries
======

Here I store my public reusable code in slim module format.

All the libraries and the module manager are in the /libs folder.  

Just DO the slim.r file and then you have access to all the modules which are relative to it, and your application, as well as any %libs/ subfolder.

If you are given one or more libraries from another project (like glass), you can just dump them in a sub-folder or in the root and they will be accessible without any configuration required.
